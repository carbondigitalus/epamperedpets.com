          <p class="style7">We are  professional, in-home, pet service providers.  This is what we do and  we love doing it.  There is no need to worry about us not showing up  or to feel like you are imposing on us, like you might have to do if  you asked a neighbor, a friend, or your family. </p>
          <p class="style7">Using  in-home pet services to pamper your pet(s) allows….</p>
          <ul class="style7">
            <li>
              <p>you to  	feel comfortable when you are away, knowing that your pet(s) are  	being loved and pampered where they are the happiest and safest, in  	their own home. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>your  	pet to maintain a daily schedule, which helps you and your pet(s)  	deal with your absence better.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>quality  	time with your pets, including exercise and playtime, and  	personalized loving attention</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="style7">Using a  professional in-home pet service provider also provides added  security by keeping up your routines and giving your home that “Hey  someone is still here” look even while you are away. </p>
          <p class="style7"><U><strong>The  Pampered Pet Advantage</strong></U><em>. </em> </p>
          <p class="style7">We take our  reputation for <strong>professionalism </strong>very seriously and only work  with pet service providers who are professionals and stay up to date  on pet related trends and information, while actively pursuing ways  to protect you, your pet(s) and our environment.</p>
          <p class="style7">We are <strong>insured bonded and veterinarian  recommended</strong>.  You will not  need to worry about your pet’s or home’s well being while in our  care.</p>
          <p class="style7">We strive  to <strong>make our environment better</strong> than we found it.  The average distance traveled to a client’s home  is 3-7 miles, which helps us to keep our carbon “paw print” down.   We use automation and other technological tools when possible to  help reduce our paper use in the office and in your home.</p>
        <p class="style7">We offer a <strong>wide range of services</strong> all of which are designed to increase your peace of mind.  By  diversifying our services, we can usually do things that are a greater  value to you than if you were to pay for these services separately.</p>
        <p class="style7">We are very <strong>flexible</strong> when dealing with your pet(s).  We understand that your pet(s) and  his or her relationship with you are as unique as you are, so we do  not take a cookie cutter approach to their care.  We do have basic  services that are provided to all pets and clients, but will tailor  our services to meet your, and your pet(s) needs and budget.</p></td>
