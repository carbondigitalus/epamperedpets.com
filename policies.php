This keeps your lawn clean and safe and your time freed up to enjoy your family, friends, and pet(s). We can even remove the waste and dispose of it in a way that is more friendly to our environment. </p></td>

The walks last from 15 to 20 minutes. In most instances, we can handle walking two pets at one time. </p></td>

          <p class="style4 style10">Our favorite by far. We come to your home and provide so much more than the basics for your pet. We begin with fresh food and water, potty breaks, playtime and companionship. We can also add to your homes overall security by bringing in your mail, adjusting your lights and blinds, and conducting a security check. Some pet parents like for us to provide service on a daily and weekly basis, while others only need it while they are away on business or vacation. </p></td>

        <p><span class="style2"><strong>Payment for Service</strong> <br />
        We offer several methods of payment for services. </span></p>
        <ul>
          <li class="style3A"><span class="style2">Checks and money orders </span></li>
          <li class="style3A"><span class="style2">Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, and American Express).  </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="style2">It is Pampered Pets’ Policy to receive payment for services prior to services being rendered.  If you have elected to maintain a credit card on file with us, then the funds will be automatically collected the day of the first service.   </span></p>
        <p><span class="style2">If you intend to pay on delivery (POD) then please contact the office before your services begins.  In some  rare cases, there may be a $5.00 service charge for this payment arrangement. </span></p>
        <p><span class="style2">Monthly service contracts are discounted if you decide to prepay semi-annually, or annually.  If you elect not to take advantage of the prepayment discount, then you will receive an invoice at the conclusion of the billing cycle.  The billing cycle ends on the 20th of each month.  We will mail or email you an invoice on the 21st.  Payment will be due on the 1st of the next month.  (i.e.  February’s cycle ends February 20th and payment is due March 1st)  If you would like to use the payment method that you have on file with us as your source of payment, then do nothing.  We will take care of the payment automatically for you.   If however you would like to pay by some other means, then please call or email the office with your alternative payment option.   </span></p>
        <p><span class="style2"><strong>Returned Checks</strong>  <br />
          There will be a $25.00 handling charge, in addition to any charges presented by the bank, for checks returned for any reason. </span></p>
        <p><span class="style2"><strong>Overdue Payment </strong>– (for monthly service contracts) <br />
          Payment is expected within 10 days of the date of invoice and will be considered overdue if not received by the invoice due date.  We reserve the right to charge a 10% late fee to all accounts with an overdue balance.   </span></p>
        <p><span class="style2"><strong>Reservations</strong>  <br />
          All pet sitting reservations MUST come through the Pampered Pets reservation system.  This ensures that your services are covered under our insurance policy and ensures that you and your pet(s) will receive the best possible care.  You can make a reservation for our service online, by phone, or by email. See our &quot;<a href="reservations.html">Reservations</a>&quot; page for details</span></p>
        <p class="style2"><strong>Appointment Times</strong> <br />
        We aim to satisfy all our clients, so Pampered Pets does not have set hours.  However, we do work within 4 hour time blocks.  This ensures that each customer’s individual needs are taken care of.  If your pet needs medication or some other special attention at a particular time, let us know when you register for your services and we will make every attempt to meet these needs. </p>
        <p class="style2"><strong>Initial Consultation</strong> <br />
        Before you can request services with us, an initial consultation must be completed.  It has been our experience that these consultations are the best way to determine if we are the right service provider for you.  During our consultation, a Pampered Pets Professional Pet Sitter will meet in your home with you and your pets in order to find out pertinent information about the medical history and behavioral habits of your pet(s), their present condition and care needed in our absence, plus information about the security of your home. At the initial interview, please provide 2 sets of house keys and any pertinent information to the pet sitter.</p></td>
