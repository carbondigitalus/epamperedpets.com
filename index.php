We begin with fresh food and water, potty breaks, playtime and companionship. We can also add to your homes overall security by bringing in your mail, adjusting your lights and blinds, and conducting a security check. Some pet parents like for us to provide service on a daily and weekly basis, while others only need it while they are away on business or vacation. </p></td>
