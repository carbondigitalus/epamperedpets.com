  &copy;2013 <a href="http://www.WhosDoggie.com" target="_blank">Who's Your Doggie</a>.</span></p>
    <p><br />
      <a href="http://www.WhosDoggie.com" target="_blank"><img width="200" height="120" src="images/whosyourdoggie.png" align="right" hspace="12" alt="Who's Your Doggie14788-Finallogo-D4logo1.jpg" /></a><span class="style2">When people  discover that I work with dogs, most of the time I get one simple question –  &ldquo;How do I get my dog to stop jumping?&rdquo; In addition to being rather annoying,  jumping can be potentially dangerous in cases where the dog is bigger or  stronger than the recipient of this sign of affection. I truly understand and  appreciate the question. However, I really answer the question, &ldquo;what can I do  for my dog so he does not want to jump on me.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="style2">Jumping is a  natural behavior for dogs. When dogs greet each other, they meet face to face  and sniff each other&rsquo;s muzzles. In most cases, when a dog jumps on you it is  simply to greet you face to face. The bigger problem we encounter with jumping  is that we have encouraged jumping in our dogs, usually without realizing it.  We start teaching jumping very early in our dog&rsquo;s life. As a puppy, we  encourage jumping. It is fun when the puppy jumps on us and licks our faces.  Unfortunately, as the puppy gets older and bigger, the jumping is no longer  cute and can become frustrating. The most common ways to stop jumping is to  push the dog away or to yell at the dog. While these techniques may work in  rare instances, they actually reinforce the jumping. Dogs interpret pushing as  an attempt to play. People tend to get more animated and excited when yelling.  This, too, signals to the dog that play is to be initiated.</p>
    <p class="style2">The first  step in reducing jumping is to remove any reinforcement or attention. When your  dog jumps on you, turn 180º away from the dog and ignore the dog. When all four  paws are on the floor, immediately say &ldquo;Good&rdquo; and reward the dog with a pet or  a treat. If your dog knows the Sit cue, you can incorporate it into the  training. When your dog jumps say, &ldquo;Sit&rdquo; and reward your dog for sitting. Sit  is a great tool because it is incompatible with jumping. In other words, a  sitting dog cannot jump on you. From a behavior perspective, it is always  better to teach a behavior you want (Sit) rather than trying to stop a behavior  you want to stop (jumping). In the end, you will teach your dog that good  things happen when sitting, which will have effects beyond jumping.</p>
    <p class="style2">Totally  ignoring your dog is a great way to reduce the jumping, but it is just the  start. If you are only trying to train your dog when he is jumping, you will  have limited results. It is always better to reinforce the behavior you want at  random times. If your dog walks past you without jumping, it is a perfect  opportunity to praise or treat your dog for having four paws are on the ground.  The more you reward the dog for the correct behavior, the easier it is for the  dog to recognize the lack of reward for jumping. As you encourage the behavior  you want, the less frequently the dog will jump.</p>
    <p class="style2">If you want  to remove jumping from your dog&rsquo;s repertoire of behaviors, you must enforce a Zero  Tolerance policy. This includes all family members, friends, and anyone that  will encounter your dog. It is up to you to educate everyone on how they should  respond to your dog if he decides to jump. If you allow your dog to jump on  just one person, it will set back your training routine since it will confuse  your dog. Dogs are not good at trying to figure out whom they can jump on and  those they cannot. For your part, the best course of action is to teach your  dog Sit and Stay when greeting people. This will reinforce your dog&rsquo;s notion  that good things happen when sitting. </p>
    <p class="style2">Unfortunately,  we all know someone that has no problem ignoring your Zero Tolerance policy. In  fact, they tend to encourage jumping and justify their actions by saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  OK, dogs love me.&rdquo; This is always a tough situation. You will need to decide  how to handle it. For me, nothing beats a good Sit and Stay to ensure such a  situation will not occur.</p>
    <p class="style2">When  developing a plan to help your dog stop jumping, ask yourself, &ldquo;What am I doing  to encourage jumping.&rdquo; It could be as simple as your dog is excited to see you.  In this case, bring yourself down to the dog&rsquo;s level so jumping is not  necessary. Remember, jumping is a side effect of their devotion to you. </p>
