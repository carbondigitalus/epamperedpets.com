This keeps your lawn clean and safe and your time freed up to enjoy your family, friends, and pet(s). We can even remove the waste and dispose of it in a way that is more friendly to our environment. </p></td>

          <p class="style4 style10">Our favorite by far. We come to your home and provide so much more than the basics for your pet. We begin with fresh food and water, potty breaks, playtime and companionship. We can also add to your homes overall security by bringing in your mail, adjusting your lights and blinds, and conducting a security check. Some pet parents like for us to provide service on a daily and weekly basis, while others only need it while they are away on business or vacation. </p></td>

              </div>
              <p class="style2">All pet sitting reservations MUST come through the Pampered Pets reservation system. This ensures that your services are covered under our insurance policy and ensures that you and your pet(s) will receive the best possible care. </p>
              <p class="style2">You can make a reservation for our service online, by phone, or by email.<br /></p>
              <p class="style2">Phone: <a href="tel:717-214-1994">(717) 214-1994</a><br /><br/>

              Current Clients: <a href="https://leashtime.com/login-page.php?bizid=170" target="_blank"><strong>Online Reservations</strong></a></p>
              <p class="style2">Once we know what service you are looking for, we will match you up with the right sitter and then confirm with you the services requested.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Appointment Times<br />
              </strong>We aim to satisfy all our clients, so Pampered Pets does not have set hours. However, we do work within 4 hour time blocks. This ensures that each customer’s individual needs are taken care of. If your pet needs medication or some other special attention at a particular hour, let us know when you register for your services and we will make every attempt to meet these needs.</p>
              <p class="style2"><strong>Initial Consultation</strong><br />
                Before you can request services with us, an initial consultation must be completed. Again, it has been our experience that these consultations are the best way to determine if we are the right service provider for you. During our consultation, a Pampered Pets Professional Pet Sitter will meet in your home with you and your pets in order to find out pertinent information about the medical history and behavioral habits of your pet(s), their present condition and care needed in our absence, plus information about the security of your home. At the initial interview, the following needs to be presented to the pet sitter:<br />
                Pet Photo<br />
                2 sets of house keys<br />
                Vaccine records<br />
              Any pertinent information</p></td>
